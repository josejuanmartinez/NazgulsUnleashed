In pursuit of forbidden powers, he struck a dark bargain with an aged Haradan priest, trading his eyesight for the Eyes of the Well, gemstones that granted him sorcery skills. His first heinous act with his newfound powers was to drive his father, Ciryamir, to despair and suicide, seizing control of his family's lands.\n\nHis relentless quest for dominance eventually led him into a sinister covenant with Sauron, resulting in his transformation into one of the [ringwraiths|E]. As a bearer of one of the [nineringsofmen|E], Akhôrahil now commands the dark forces from the ancient halls of [GetTitleByKey('c_luglurak').GetNameNoTier], where he serves as one of Sauron’s most feared sorcerers and lorekeepers."

Originally from the city of Korosglin in the Republic of Kîr, he ascended to power as the youngest governor ever elected against the expanding influence of [numenor|E]. Known for his lethal skills and silent executions, he was a professional killer who struck his enemies at dawn, their bodies discovered as the first light crept across the lands.\n\nThis deadly prowess attracked Sauron's gaze, who then bestowed upon him one of the [nineringsofmen|E] in S.A. 2001. After Sauron's fall, Dawndeath retreated into the shadows, resurfacing in the Third Age to orchestrate terror from his stronghold of Nârgil in [nurn|E], continuing his legacy of fear and domination."
