You survived treachery against your royal Ioriag ruling family in Khand, which filled you with anger and wish for revenge. Exiled in [GetTitleByKey('b_obamarl').GetNameNoTier], your destiny aligned with Sauron's ambitions, who gifted you one of the [nineringsofmen|E].\n\nFrom the ancient halls of Ôlbamarl, you secretly observe Khand's fate, while swiftly riding beyond your borders harboring ambitions. [GetTitleByKey('c_tol_buruth').GetNameNoTier], your hidden fortress in the Sea of Rhûn, aims to challenge [dorwinion|E] power. [GetTitleByKey('c_ongushar').GetNameNoTier], a settlement of exiled Rhûn Easterlings in the Brown Lands strengthens your cause against Rohan's expansionism. You have served as the messenger between Dol Guldur and Mordor, but the Dark Lord has now plans for you in the conquest of Middle-Earth."

 nazguls_unleashed.0005.desc:0 "As Khôrahil, known also as the Blind Sorceror, your dark journey began in [numenor|E], born into a family of power and descent. Signing a perverse pact with an aged Haradan priest, you exchanged your eyes for two great gems – the Eyes of the Well, which enabled you to cast deadly spells. Your first objective was your father, Ciryamir. Your dark arts instilled such despair in him that he took his own life, allowing you to usurp his throne.\n\nDriven by an insatiable hunger for power, your actions led you to an unholy alliance with Sauron, sealing your fate and transformation into one of the [sauroncharacter|E]'s [ringwraiths|E]. Bearing one of the cursed [nineringsofmen|E], you wield terror and command forces of darkness from the ancient halls of [GetTitleByKey('b_luglurak').GetNameNoTier], where you serve as Sauron's most devoted sorcerer and loremaster."

 nazguls_unleashed.0004.desc:0 "As Jí-Indûr, also feared as Dawndeath, your story unfolds with your origins in the city of Korosglin, where you rose from the ranks of the wealthiest family to the youngest governor ever elected. What once started as mere schemas and manipulations, later on turned into torture and silent executions of those who opposed him. You forged a formidable identity amidst the political machinations to protect your commercial dominions against the expanding influence of [numenor|E]. This quest for power led to an alliance with [sauroncharacter|E], transforming you into one of the dreaded [ringwraiths|E] after being given one of the [nineringsofmen|E].\n\nYou operate from the shadows, taking advantage of twilight and dawn, which earned you the name of 'Dawndeath'. Your dominion of terror extends from the shadowy stronghold of [GetTitleByKey('b_cirith_nargil').GetNameNoTier] under the dark influence of Êphil Duath, where you continue to serve Sauron's dark purposes as his most lethal spymaster and strategic mastermind."
