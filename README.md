[h2]Introduction: retro-lore of the Lord of the Rings[/h2]

Besides the canonical lore penned by J.R.R. Tolkien, a rich tapestry of non-canon lore has flourished in the years following his passing. One of the pioneering entities in expanding this lore was [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Crown_Enterprises]Iron Crown Enterprises (I.C.E)[/url], renowned for their Middle Earth Role-playing Game [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_Role_Playing]MERP[/url] released in 1984. This tabletop RPG provided enthusiasts with an immersive platform to explore Tolkien's world beyond the confines of his novels.

Building upon MERP's foundation, the 1990s saw the advent of Middle Earth Play By Mail, a turn-based strategy game boasting a diverse array of factions vying for dominance. Still actively played via email today, it continues to captivate a dedicated community of players. Furthermore, the lore of these games found expression in online platforms like 
 [url=https://notionclubarchives.fandom.com/wiki/Elendor_(MUSH]Elendor MUSH[/url], offering text-based RPG experiences set in Middle Earth.

The wealth of lore generated by these endeavors, akin to DLCs in contemporary video games, has enriched the experiences of aficionados, providing a treasure trove of additional content and narratives. For many, these ventures evoke a sense of nostalgia for the bygone days of exploration within Tolkien's fantastical realm, inspiring creative endeavors such as the creation of submods.

While crafted out of personal nostalgia, the sharing of such endeavors perpetuates the spirit of community and passion for Middle Earth lore among enthusiasts.

[h2]Modifications to Realms in Exile[/h2]

This mod aims to follow Realms In Exile take on Er-Mûrazôr and Khamûl, captains with own territories, but expanding it to the rest of the nazguls following the lore from the previously described sources.

[h3]0.1[/h3]

[b]Er-Mûrazôr[/b]

No changes. I highly recommend to give more flavor to this nation, downloading [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3170042775&searchtext=Witch+King]The Witch-King of Angmar[/url].

[b]Khamûl[/b]

No changes.

[b]Ovatha, the Black Horseman[/b]

_Led by the Ninth of the Nazgûl, the Long Rider, the nation of Ûvatha controls one of the most extensive realms of the Dark Servants. From his main fortress in Mordor, the Long Rider's minions infiltrate and pressure many of the peoples that inhabit Rhovanion and the region of Khand. The skilled agents of the Long Rider are able to exert considerable influence on mercantile operations throughout these regions, whilst the vast realm of Ûvatha is patrolled by the superior cavalry that serve as the bulwark of his armies. Perhaps not as highly regarded as some riders, nevertheless the exclusively mounted forces of the Long Rider are numerous, well-provisioned and quite capable of carrying out the planned expansion of the Long Rider's domain. The rich lands found in his realm provide a strong potential for this growth._

- Ongushar province moves from the surroundings of Fangorn to Rhovanion - more speficially to the Brown Lands.

[h3]0.2 (planned)[/h3]

[b]Akhôrahil, the Blind Sorcerer[/b]

_Led by the Fifth of the Nazgûl, the Blind Sorcerer, the nation of Akhôrahil represents one of the most dangerous conclaves of mages in possession of powerful artifacts among all the Dark Servants. From his main fortress in south-eastern Mordor, the Blind Sorcerer's adepts prepare for the inevitable expansion of his domain into Harad and Khand. Akhôrahil possesses one of the richest regions from which to operate, and controls one of the few navies serving the Dark Servants. Although lacking individuals skilled in the more subtle means of persuasion, the Blind Sorcerer is surrounded by powerful mages and well-supplied forces, and his armies and navies are swiftly becoming a force with which to be reckoned._

[h3]0.3 (planned)[/h3]

[b]Jí Indûr, the Cloud Lord[/b]

_Led by the Fourth of the Nazgûl, the Cloud Lord, the nation of Jí Indûr is probably the most secretive of all the Dark Servants. From his main fortress in south-western Mordor, the Cloud Lord's minions perform the most delicate of extractions and arrange the most unobtrusive of accidents for the leaders of the Free Peoples. As a result of the exploits of his highly-skilled agents, Jí Indûr also influences and oversees much of the trade and commerce that passes through Harondor. His knowledge of the affairs and plans of his neighbours has allowed the Cloud Lord to begin preparing his forces, both military and arcane, in preparation for his own plans of expansion and domination._
